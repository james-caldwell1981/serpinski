# serpinski

### The two primary goals of this project are:
- Generate a Serpinski Triangle in 2 dimensions stored within a graph object
- Gain experience and better understanding of working with multiple data structures
### Some longer term goals are as follows:
- Represent the values in multiple ways; ie actual value, binary, sparse
- Visualize using a scatter plot
- Generate surrounding nodes given input of row, row position, and value
- Add a 3rd dimension

### Because this project is just beginning, there isn't much here yet, so check back soon!
